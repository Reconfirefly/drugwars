# drugwars
drugwars is a simple trading game where you try and make as much money as you can in a set 
time period (try either a week for a quick game, or a month for a longer one), with some
surprises along the way. Move between cities to get different prices for your drug stash,
and remember the golden rule: buy low, sell high!

For reference, the drugs fluctuate between the prices listed in the parenthesis, but they
can change wildly with events.

    Drugs("Cocaine", (15000, 28000)),
    Drugs("Heroin", (2000, 10000)),
    Drugs("Weed", (300, 1000)),
    Drugs("Hash", (200, 1200)),
    Drugs("Opium", (400, 1800)),
    Drugs("Acid", (1000, 4200)),
    Drugs("Ludes", (18, 75))
    
You can also get stopped by officer Leroy and have some cash/drugs taken. 

So yeah, that's about it. Nothing too riveting, but its a neat time killer if you've got a few minutes.
